# British Airways Data Science Job Simulation (Forage)  

## Overview  

Completed the British Airways Data Science Virtual Job Simulation on Forage, tackling a real-world business scenario in airline operations. Built an end-to-end predictive model to forecast passenger lounge demand and eligibility utilizing a Random Forest algorithm.  

## Project Highlights  

- Developed a robust predictive model using Random Forest, achieving **85% accuracy** on test data.  
- Performed data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis with pandas and scikit-learn.  
- Analyzed categorical and numerical features to optimize model performance.  
- Provided actionable insights for future lounge scheduling optimization based on model results.  

## Approach  

1. **Data Understanding:** Explored and visualized multi-source categorical passenger data.  
2. **Preprocessing:** Handled missing values and encoded categorical variables.  
3. **Model Training:** Experimented with various machine learning techniques; Random Forest yielded best accuracy.  
4. **Evaluation:** Assessed model using accuracy score and feature importance analysis.  
5. **Business Impact:** Presented recommendations to improve operational decision-making and lounge resource allocation.  

## Key Technologies  

- Python (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, scikit-learn)  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- Data visualization & feature engineering  

## Results  

- The accuracy of the model was approximately 0.85 (Precision) and 0.12 (Recall), showing that this model requires more improvement which can be achieved by adding more customer-centric features into the data.  
- One of the most important variable in the model was purchase_lead, that is the time between purchase and departure.
